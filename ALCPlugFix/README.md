## **Use Hackintool to determine your audio layout's pin configuration. For T480s owners with `ALC257`, it will most likely be the same and you can simply install my prebuilt files.**

Build
-------

By default its code command is for **Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th Gen** with **`ALC285`** Audio Codec with Combo Jack, you may need to change that in `ALCPlugFix/main.m`'s `fixAudio` function:   
![ALCPlugFix_fixAudio](https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh/blob/master/docs/img/ALCPlugFix_fixAudio.png)   

After `fixAudio` has been adjusted according to your pin layout, run:  
```
xcodebuild -target ALCPlugFix
```
Now copy the built `ALCPlugFix` to `alc_fix/`.  

Install
-------
Running `sh ./install.sh` will install to `/user/local/bin`.

By default it search `hda-verb` in current work directory, if not found it will search in `$PATH` _(May not work when it is running from LaunchDaemon because it is using as root)_.
